code accompanying the paper: "A melancholy machine: simulated synapse loss induces depression-like behaviors in deep reinforcement learning"

For an interactive demo of the environment, run environment_demo.py

The scripts/ folder contains scripts used to generate data in the paper. Running the scripts train_agents.py, compare_exploration.py, rehabilitate.py, and weight_update.py will run most experiments and save the data in scripts/data/.
The various "view" scripts can then be run to generate charts from the saved data.
